After receiving feedback from customers around accessing Statements we have made them available within the Merchant Dashboard. All Statements created after 1 September 2024 will be available.

Statements are available for Admin Users only and available under Settings Â» Statements. As part of this release the old 'Cost of Acceptance' UI has been depreciated. Please contact support if you need access this data.

The Statement has been refreshed to offer greater clarity of information around your transactions and associated fees.

## Improvements

- **Statements:** Chargeback Fees available as own line item
- **Merchant Dashboard:** Statements available under ..
- **Email Notification:** Users can subscribe to a notification email which is sent out when a new Statement is available.
