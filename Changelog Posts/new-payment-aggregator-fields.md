Fat Zebra has added support for new [Payment Aggregator fields](https://docs.fatzebra.com/docs/payment-aggregators). These fields only apply to certain merchants who have been enabled as a Payment Aggregator with their acquirer and wish to send transactions on behalf of a merchant. No change is required for all other merchants.

For more information, refer to https://docs.fatzebra.com/docs/payment-aggregators
