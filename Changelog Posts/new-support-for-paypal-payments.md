Fat Zebra will be releasing an integration with PayPal in the coming weeks that will allow merchants to add PayPal as a payment method on their websites.

Currently this integration is being tested with a subset of pilot merchants, and we have updated the Fat Zebra Ruby SDK to support this pilot rollout.

We will be releasing further documentation on the PayPal integration in the coming weeks when this feature goes live.

Please contact your Fat Zebra representative or the Fat Zebra support team if you are interested in this integration.
