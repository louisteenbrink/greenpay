# Pre-requisites

1. Read the [Google Pay Web Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines)
2. Follow Google Pay's [Deploy production environment guidelines]\(Follow Google Pay's Deploy production environment guidelines). In this step you will obtain a **merchantID**. By integrating Google Pay, you agree to Google's [terms of service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos).
3. Contact the [Cloud Payments support team](mailto:support@cloudpayments.com.au) to have Google Pay enabled on your account. You will be supplied a **gatewayMerchantID**. 

# Implementation Steps

Follow the instructions in the following Google guides to implement a Google Pay button in your app:

- [Google Pay Web developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/overview)
- [Google Pay Web integration checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)

When setting up the _tokenizationSpecification_ object, specify the following values for the **gateway** and **gatewayMerchantId** values:

```javascript
const tokenizationSpecification = {
  type: 'PAYMENT_GATEWAY',
  parameters: {
    'gateway': 'fatzebra',
    'gatewayMerchantId': '<provided by Fat Zebra>'
  }
};
```

The Google Pay button will generate an encrypted token that you must then include in a request to the Cloud Payments API to:

- Create a purchase using the card in the Google Pay payload
- Or tokenize the card details in the Google Pay payload

The following documentation outlines the format of the two API calls:

- [Create a purchase using a wallet](ref:create-a-purchase-with-wallet)
- [Tokenize a card with wallet credentials](ref:tokenize-a-card-with-wallet-credentials)
